After Cloning The Project, try directing your cmd to the clone folder

Do this I think..

1. `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. `npm install`
3. `yarn install` (just to make sure, I totally forgot what package I have installed in this project)

Finally run the program using:
3. expo start

later on there will be a qr code in your cmd after running `expo start` 
you can scan the qr code using your phone by downloading the app "Expo Go"

*YOU CAN ONLY SCAN THE QR USING THE "EXPO GO" APP*
